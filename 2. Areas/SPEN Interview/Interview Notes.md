_“How would you implement a data strategy within a licensed organisation?”_

**Data Strategy**

Digitalising the energy system and improving access to this growing, rich data landscape will unlock stakeholder benefits and accelerate the transition to net zero. Our data is an organisational asset, capable of improving our decision making, operations and service to customers. Sharing our data with external parties will lead to better whole system solutions and new, innovative ways of working.

Data can improve our decision making, operations and customer services. Sharing data with others will lead to better whole system solutions and innovative ways of working.

-   We will introduce enhanced data governance across each of our business areas.
-   Deploy fully integrated reporting and analytics using a new big data platform.
-   Utilise enhanced data capture to maximise the value of our digital twins.
-   Implement solutions to comply with the principles from the Data Best Practice Guidance, enabling open data sharing.

****An agile delivery approach will be used in delivering all data related projects. 
The Agile Manifesto embodies the
following core values:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan	
	
What is design thinking? **While Agile is an approach to problem solving, design thinking is an approach to problem finding**.

****Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.”

Delivery  method

Maturity and review

A data lake is different, because it stores relational data from line of business applications, and non-relational data from mobile apps, IoT devices, and social media. The structure of the data or schema is not defined when data is captured. This means you can store all of your data without careful design or the need to know what questions you might need answers for in the future. Different types of analytics on your data like SQL queries, big data analytics, full text search, real-time analytics, and machine learning can be used to uncover insights.

A data warehouse is a database optimized to analyze relational data coming from transactional systems and line of business applications. The data structure, and schema are defined in advance to optimize for fast SQL queries, where the results are typically used for operational reporting and analysis. Data is cleaned, enriched, and transformed so it can act as the “single source of truth” that users can trust.

## The challenges of Data Lakes

The main challenge with a data lake architecture is that raw data is stored with no oversight of the contents. For a data lake to make data usable, it needs to have defined mechanisms to catalog, and secure data. Without these elements, data cannot be found, or trusted resulting in a “data swamp." Meeting the needs of wider audiences require data lakes to have governance, semantic consistency, and access controls.

Our roadmap for data will be developed collaboratively and through continuous engagement with our stakeholders

We will introduce training on open / shared data - principles, risk assessments and support for culture change

.We have played an active role in the Energy Networks Association’s “National Energy System Map” (NESM) project.

Our data governance framework will establish the rules and processes to control and assure the data that we use. It will allow us to identify and mitigate risks, comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and ensure that we maximise the value of data to our organisation and for our stakeholders.

Data mastery means knowing how to use data to secure business outcomes, being able to transform data and insights into actions, having the necessary infrastructure, governance, and operations in place, and knowing how to leverage external data and enhance insights to deliver benefits. To achieve data mastery, we will introduce a virtual data governance organisation to support colleagues across the business to oversee quality, governance, and management of data. We will also introduce new conceptual, logical, and physical data maps to protect our underlying data models and provide the required data architecture to cope with the increase in volume and variety of data being captured and processed on our network. This data must be understandable, accessible, and interoperable, with a data owner assigned. (See Annex 4C.1 IT & Digitalisation: 8.4 – Data
Governance & Mastery).

We recognise the criticality of investing in data to deliver a better future quicker for more people through a digitalised energy system. Within our Data Strategy we have set out 6 critical data pillars which will underpin our broader ED2 digitalisation plans.
These pillars will enable us to manage and to use our data more effectively, in line with Ofgem’s Data Best Practice Guidance.

We will quality assure our data. We will make it more accessible for more people (internally and externally) so that we can deliver more value for our stakeholders. We will take a ‘presumed open’ approach to data because we recognise the important role that data will play in enabling a flexible energy market, by providing the stimulus for the type of product and service innovations needed to accelerate the transition to Net Zero. Our strategy also emphasises the importance of supporting our people throughout this journey to deliver a better future quicker.

Without this investment, we risk being unable to satisfy our stakeholders’ needs effectively. This becomes even more critical in the future when these 6 data pillars are mission critical to future service models. Realistically, these changes need time to land, be absorbed and be embedded in the organisation so it is important we embark on our journey towards Data Best Practice as soon as we can. There is a considerable amount of work required before the ED2 period to enable us to fully assess the needs of our stakeholders and set out a comprehensive roadmap and approach to deliver this with confidence. 

This document sets out our ambition and overarching target state, aligned with The Data Best Practice Guidance and the ambitions of the Energy Digitalisation and Energy Data Task Forces, to deliver incremental value for stakeholders and our high-level roadmap. Our proposed delivery model will provide the chance for us to learn as we go to increase the relevance and impact of our solutions for stakeholders on a sustainable basis.
