The main selection criterion for a PhD place in St Andrews is academic excellence. It is therefore very important that the School receives your complete application, including references, as early as possible.

Applications for PhD places and for funding are usually considered separately. Offers of PhD places are not always accompanied by offers of funding.

Once the School has offered PhD places, they will then select the academically best-qualified applicants for financial support. Financial support is subject to availability of funds and eligibility.

**The first meeting to decide about PhD funding is held in late January or early February, and subsequent meetings are held approximately monthly until all funding is allocated.**

## Welcome to the Mathematical Biology Group at St Andrews

![](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/mathbiol/images/image1_crop.jpeg)

We are an interdisciplinary group of mathematicians at the University of St Andrews. We develop, analyse and simulate mathematical models to study the key mechanisms which underpin the dynamics of biological systems. Our current research interests include multiscale models of cancer growth and treatment, mathematical models arising from theoretical ecology, partial differential equations on evolving manifolds, biological pattern formation, free boundary problems in biology and evolutionary dynamics in structured populations.
