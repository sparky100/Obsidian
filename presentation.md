**Data Strategy

*A data strategy is a highly dynamic process employed to support the acquisition, organization, analysis, and delivery of data in support of business objectives.

*"chart a high-level course of action to achieve high-level goals,”

Data Strategy is driven by your organization’s overall Business Strategy and business model.”

“A coherent strategy for organizing, governing, analyzing, and deploying an organization’s information assets that can be applied across industries and levels of data maturity.” 

Not treated  as an asset - **not just a by product**

-   A strong [Data Management](http://www.dataversity.net/what-is-data-management/) vision
-   A strong business case/reason
-   Guiding principles, values, and management perspectives
-   Well-considered goals for the data assets under management
-   Metrics and measurements of success
-   Short-term and long-term program objectives
-   Suitably designed and understood roles and responsibilities

The idea behind developing a data strategy is to make sure all data resources are posi-  
tioned in such a way that they can be used, shared and moved easily and efficiently.  
Data is no longer a byproduct of business processing – it’s a critical asset that enables  
processing and decision making. A data strategy helps by ensuring that data is  
managed and used like an asset. It provides a common set of goals and objectives  
across projects to ensure data is used both effectively and efficiently. A data strategy  
establishes common methods, practices and processes to manage, manipulate and  
share data across the enterprise in a repeatable manner
