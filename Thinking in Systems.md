## Notes
### Chapter 1 -  System Structure and Behaviour
*Purposes are deduced from behaviour, not from rhetoric or stated goals.

*To ask whether elements, interconnections, or purposes are most important in a system is to ask an unsystemic question. All are essential. All interact. All have their roles. But the least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behaviour. Interconnections are also critically important. Changing relationships usually changes system behaviour. The elements, the parts of systems we are most likely to notice, are often (not always) least important in defining
the unique characteristics of the system—unless changing an element also
results in changing relationships or purpose*.

**A stock is the foundation of any system. Stocks are the elements of the
system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time.

* As long as the sum of all inflows exceeds the sum of all outflows, the level of the stock will rise.
* As long as the sum of all outflows exceeds the sum of all inflows, the level of the stock will fall.
* If the sum of all outflows equals the sum of all inflows, the stock level will not change; it will be held in dynamic equilibrium at whatever level it happened to be when the two sets of flows became equal.

Important  to recognise the impact of outflows as well as in flows.

*A breakthrough in energy efficiency is equivalent, in its effect on the stock of available oil, to the discovery of a new oil field—although different people profit from it.

*A stock takes time to change, because flows take time to flow

If you have a sense of the rates of change of stocks, you don’t expect things to happen faster than they can happen. You don’t give up too soon.

*Stocks allow inﬂows and independent of each other and temporarily out of
outﬂows to be decouple and to be independent and temporarily out of
balance with each other.

*Human beings have invented hundreds of stock-maintaining mechanisms to make inflows and outflows independent and stable.

*Systems of information-feedback control are fundamental to all life and human endeavour, from the slow pace of biological evolution to the launching of the latest space satellite. . . . Everything we do as individuals, as an industry, or as a society is done in the
context of an information-feedback system.

**Stabilizing Loops—Balancing Feedback**

This kind of stabilising, goal-seeking, regulating loop is called a balancing feedback loop, so I put a B inside the loop in the diagram. Balancing feedback loops are goal-seeking or stability-seeking.
