## Notes
### Chapter 1 -  System Structure and Behaviour
*Purposes are deduced from behaviour, not from rhetoric or stated goals.
To ask whether elements, interconnections, or purposes are most important in a system is to ask an unsystemic question. All are essential. All interact. All have their roles. But the least obvious part of the system, its function or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system’s behaviour. Interconnections are also critically important. Changing relationships usually changes system behaviour. The elements, the parts of systems we are most likely to notice, are often (not always) least important in defining
the unique characteristics of the system—unless changing an element also
results in changing relationships or purpose.*

**A stock is the foundation of any system. Stocks are the elements of the
system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time.
* As long as the sum of all inflows exceeds the sum of all outflows, the level of the stock will rise.
* As long as the sum of all outflows exceeds the sum of all inflows, the level of the stock will fall.
* If the sum of all outflows equals the sum of all inflows, the stock level will not change; it will be held in dynamic equilibrium at whatever level it happened to be when the two sets of flows became equal.

Important  to recognise the impact of outflows as well as in flows.

*A breakhrough in energy efficiency is equivalent, in its effect on the stock of available oil, to the discovery of a new oil field—although different people profit from it.

*A stock takes time to change, because flows take time to flow
