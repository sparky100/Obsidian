**Data Strategy**

Digitalising the energy system and improving access to this growing, rich data landscape will unlock stakeholder benefits and accelerate the transition to net zero. Our data is an organisational asset, capable of improving our decision making, operations and service to customers. Sharing our data with external parties will lead to better whole system solutions and new, innovative ways of working.

Data can improve our decision making, operations and customer services. Sharing data with others will lead to better whole system solutions and innovative ways of working.

-   We will introduce enhanced data governance across each of our business areas.
-   Deploy fully integrated reporting and analytics using a new big data platform.
-   Utilise enhanced data capture to maximise the value of our digital twins.
-   Implement solutions to comply with the principles from the Data Best Practice Guidance, enabling open data sharing.

3. Describe data accurately using industry standard Metadata.
4. Enable potential Data Users to understand Data Assets by providing supporting
information.
5. Make Data Assets discoverable for potential Data Users.
6. Learn and deliver to the needs of current and prospective Data Users.
7. Ensure data quality maintenance and improvement is prioritised by Data User needs.
8. Ensure Data Assets are interoperable with Data Assets from other data and digital
services.
9. Protect Data Assets and systems in accordance with Security, Privacy and Resilience
(SPaR) best practice.
10. Store, archive and provide access to Data Assets in ways that ensure sustained
benefits.
11. Treat all Data Assets, their associated Metadata and Software Scripts used to process
Data Assets as Presumed Open.
