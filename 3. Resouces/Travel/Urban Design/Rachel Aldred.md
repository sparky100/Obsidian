### Career
Her 2017 study into inequalities in self-report road injury risk in London[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Aldred#cite_note-16) was the first to use National Travel Survey data to analyse risk for those walking, finding that disabled and low-income pedestrians were far more likely to injured.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Aldred#cite_note-17) In 2018 the new schools layer of the Propensity to Cycle tool calculated that children in England would be twenty times more likely to cycle to school with better transport planning.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Aldred#cite_note-18)

Between 2012 and 2018[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Aldred#cite_note-19) she was an elected trustee of the [London Cycling Campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Cycling_Campaign "London Cycling Campaign") and in 2016 was awarded the Economic and Social Research Council ([ERSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Social_Research_Council "Economic and Social Research Council")) award for outstanding impact in public policy.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Aldred#cite_note-20) She is a trustee of the [Road Safety Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Road_Safety_Trust&action=edit&redlink=1 "Road Safety Trust (page does not exist)") and was a guest speaker on an episode[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Aldred#cite_note-21) of [Ed MIlliband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Miliband "Ed Miliband")'s _Reasons to be Cheerful_ podcast.
