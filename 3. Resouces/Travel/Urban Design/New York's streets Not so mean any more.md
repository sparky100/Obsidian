## Summary 
*In this funny and thought-provoking talk, [[Janette Sadik-Khan]], transportation commissioner of New York City, shares projects that have reshaped street life in the 5 boroughs, including pedestrian zones in Times Square, high-performance buses and a 6,000-cycle-strong bike share. Her mantra: Do bold experiments that are cheap to try out.*

## Notes
### Goals
So we worked hard to refocus our agenda, 
* to maximize efficient mobility, 
* providing more room for buses, 
* more room for bikes, 
* more room for people to enjoy the city, and
* to make our streets as safe as they can be for everybody that uses them.

we found that New York City was largely a city without seats

### Pilot/ Temporary Materials 
And the temporary materials are an important part of the program, because we were able to show how it worked. And I work for a data-driven mayor, as you probably know. So it was all about the data. So if it worked better for traffic, if it was better for mobility, if it was safer, better for business, we would keep it, and if it didn't work, no harm, no foul, we could put it back the way that it was, because these were temporary materials. And that was a very big part of the buy-in, much less anxiety when you think that something can be put back.
