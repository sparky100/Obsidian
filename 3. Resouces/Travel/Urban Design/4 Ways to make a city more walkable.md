## Summary 
Freedom from cars, freedom from sprawl, freedom to walk your city! City planner Jeff Speck shares his "general theory of walkability" -- four planning principles to transform sprawling cities of six-lane highways and 600-foot blocks into safe, walkable oases full of bike lanes and tree-lined streets.

## Notes
Why we need it [[The Walkable city]] and how we do it

It means you need to offer four things simultaneously: 
* there needs to be a proper reason to walk, 
* the walk has to be safe and feel safe, 
* the walk has to be comfortable and  
* the walk has to be interesting. 

You need to do all four of these things simultaneously, and that's the structure of my talk today, to take you through each of those.

New Urbanism movement

### Reason to walk 
The neighbourhood - compact and diverse, work, live and educate
Suburban sprawl - the opposite, only live , only work only shop, only schools

Need a neighbourhood model

Issue in cities is lack of housing
After housing comes schools

Walkable **cities** require public transport but need walkability to transport stations

### Safe
Induced  demand - widen streets. 
>Building new roads makes congestion worst

People go faster on wider streets
Skinny streets are safer
Bicycle population is a function of cycle infrastructure
Trees slow cars down
Curvature of roads

### Comfortable
We want to be able to see our predators, but we also want to feel that our flanks are covered. And so we're drawn to places that have good edges, and if you don't supply the edges, people won't want to be there

### Interesting
Signs of humanity. We are among the social primates. Nothing interests us more than other people. We want signs of people.

 >That's the general theory of walkability. Think about your own cities. Think about how you can apply it. **You've got to do all four things at once.** So find those places where you have most of them and fix what you can, fix what still needs fixing in those places.
