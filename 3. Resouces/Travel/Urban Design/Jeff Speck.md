## Summary

**Jeff Speck** is a city planner and architectural designer who, through writing, lectures, and built work, advocates internationally for more walkable cities.

As Director of Design at the [National Endowment for the Arts](http://www.arts.gov) from 2003 through 2007, he oversaw the [Mayors' Institute on City Design](http://micd.org) and created the [Governors' Institute on Community Design](http://govinstitute.org), a federal program that helps state governors fight suburban sprawl. Prior to joining the Endowment, Speck spent ten years as Director of Town Planning at [Duany Plater-Zyberk and Co.](http://dpz.com), a leading practitioner of the New Urbanism, where he led or managed more than forty of the firm's projects.

His latest book, [_Walkable City_](http://geni.us/BHgcA) -- which _Christian Science Monitor_ calls "timely and important, a delightful, insightful, irreverent work" -- has been the best-selling city-planning title of this decade.
