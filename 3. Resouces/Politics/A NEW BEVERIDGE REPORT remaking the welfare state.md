## Summary 
n 1942 William Beveridge published the report that shaped Britain’s welfare state. We’re asking what lessons it offers us nearly 80 years on. Journalist Nicholas Timmins talks us through the history of the original report then LSE’s Tania Burchardt explains how to fix the holes in our welfare safety net today.

And for World Book Day we’re chatting to author, vet and children’s TV presenter, Jess French.

## Notes
* 600k copies of the Beveridge report
* Leaking to the press
* Linking issues together
* Proposed flat payments 

The 5 evisl remain the same to a lesser or greater extent

Explains different approaches to social security - UK no longer links contributions, very heavily means tested as opposed to a contributory system

Where next - not UBI, we are not building a social security system from scratch. 
Need to recognise that payments are made when the need is greatest, when young , ill or unable to work
Some universal benefits work well
Significant reduction in benefits over last 10 years - needs to be addressed
Different definitions of poverty - used 60% of median wage

It is about linking all aspects of inequalities, can't just think about the insurance   system housing is a major issue
