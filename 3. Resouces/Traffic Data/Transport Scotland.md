## What is DATEX II?

![DATEX II](https://trafficscotland.org/images/datex/logo_datex-rid.png) The European Commission has been supporting the development of information exchange between road traffic management bodies for a number of years, primarily to deliver on European Transport policy objectives involving both the co-ordination of traffic management and development of seamless pan European services. DATEX II was designed and developed as a traffic and travel data exchange mechanism by a European task force set up to standardise the interface between traffic control and information centres.

DATEX represents the standard for applications that have been developed and implemented in Europe in the last 10 years. DATEX II allows the traffic and travel information sector to share data to deliver a comprehensive information service to the end user. For further information on DATEX II see the official [DATEX II website](https://www.datex2.eu/).
