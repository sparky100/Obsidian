[The C4 model for visualising software architecture](https://c4model.com/)

Although primarily aimed at software architects and developers, the C4 model provides a way for software development teams to efficiently and effectively communicate their software architecture, at different levels of detail, telling different stories to different types of audience, when doing up front design or retrospectively documenting an existing codebase.

Level 1: A **System Context** diagram provides a starting point, showing how the software system in scope fits into the world around it.

Level 2: A **Container** diagram zooms into the software system in scope, showing the high-level technical building blocks.

Level 3: A **Component** diagram zooms into an individual container, showing the components inside it.

Level 4: A **code** (e.g. UML class) diagram can be used to zoom into an individual component, showing how that component is implemented.

Different levels of zoom allow you to tell different stories to different audiences.
